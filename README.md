Food Delivery services like Zomato and Swiggy need to show the accurate time it will take to deliver your order to keep transparency with their customers. These companies use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the food delivery time based on how much time the delivery partners took for the same distance in the past. So, if you want to learn how to use Machine Learning for food delivery time prediction, this article is for you

Food Delivery Time Prediction
To predict the food delivery time in real-time, we need to calculate the distance between the food preparation point and the point of food consumption. After finding the distance between the restaurant and the delivery locations, we need to find relationships between the time taken by delivery partners to deliver the food in the past for the same distance.

Features:

Machine Learning Model: Predicts delivery time based on user-defined inputs.
Streamlit Deployment: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for global accessibility.
LSTM Neural Network: The model uses an LSTM network to capture dependencies in the data for more accurate predictions.

Input Features :

Age of Delivery Person: Numerical input representing the age of the delivery person.
Customer Rating for Last Order: A rating between 1 and 5 that the customer gave for their last order.
Distance of Current Order: The distance (in kilometers/miles) between the restaurant and the delivery address.

Technologies Used:

-Python
-TensorFlow & Keras (for building the LSTM model)
-Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing)
-Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)
-Matplotlib & Plotly (for visualization)
-Streamlit (for deployment)
